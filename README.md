## Level 1:
The default index.html was used and the basic date filter functionality is working

## Level 2: 
* A new index.html was created with a form with multiple dropdown menus to select each filter, then a single filter button to apply the selected filters as well as a reset button to clear the filter choices.
* The dropdown filter menus were populated with JavaScript pulling the available values for each filter from the given dataset, then sorted in ascending order.
* For user friendliness, the html will show a message indicating no records were found if the filters are not returning anything.
